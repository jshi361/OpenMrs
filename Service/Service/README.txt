index.php- proxy, generic page that collects data from all traffic and caters to no one specific crowd. Pages such as “treatment.php,” “symptoms.php,” and “articles.php” have been linked so as to provide activity and traversal in so far as it is something one can invest themself in for a “trial” amount of time that can then be tracked.


Because with OpenMRS we have access to patient information such as age, we intend to generate more valuable data by funneling age brackets to certain pages so that we can guarantee the people visiting it, and study not only individual behavior and interest, which is easily done using the Piwik service, but group behavior as well.

newsletterYA.php- linked to patients below the age of 30
newsletterMA.php- linked to patients between the ages of 30-60
newsletterE.php- linked to patients above the age of 60


stats.php- returns back limited visitor information that is logged to a database using a remote connection. The “connect-mysql.php” file is responsible for establishing the connection. Two sets are returned. One set is for the purpose of showing the status of the Visitor Log table across all rows and 4 columns. The other set is derived from the first and displays only those visitors who meet a criteria that qualifies them as a visitor that has engaged with our service for long enough to be considered “flu-sensitive,” “flu-affected,” or “flu-interested.”
